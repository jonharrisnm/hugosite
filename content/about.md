# Jon Harris
## About me:

My name is Jon Harris and I am currently a Cloud Management Specialist for VMware focusing on our Healthcare customers. In my current role at VMware I spend most of my time working with customers to show them the value they can get out of VMware vRealize product set that is focused on Automation, Costing, and Operations solutions.  In past roles I spent most of my time supporting the virtual infrastructure and working on initiatives around automating VM provisioning and IaaS. I have been doing IT for more than 18 years now. I started my career doing IT consulting in the SMB space, moved in to the enterprise space back in 2009, and have been working with VMware for 5 years now. I love working with new technologies and implementing them, I truly think that what makes me tick. In my spare time I love playing guitar, hanging with friends, and reading about/implementing new technologies.
